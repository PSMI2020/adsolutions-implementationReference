## Bookmark Tool/JS-Code to submit aderrors

This small javascript is meant to be saved as bookmark so you can run it by click.
It will load a javascript file that checks the placements on the page and sum them up in a small box to the top left corner.

The code is written in plain javascript so each browser on each device will accept it,
and theirfore it also works on mobile devices or tablets.

```

javascript:!function(){var s=document.createElement("script");s.src="https://acdn.adnxs.com/as/1d/extensions/adalert.js",document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(s);}();void(0);

```

### If you experience problems with copy/paste you can copy the following code:

javascript:!function(){var s=document.createElement("script");s.src="https://acdn.adnxs.com/as/1d/extensions/adalert.js",document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(s);}();void(0);



Please don't modify this code and use it "as is".
