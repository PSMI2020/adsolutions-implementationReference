# Using the Beta environment for display Ads

In order to use our Dev environment you should only redirect the AdLib request **from** the global Appnexus CDN **to** the Ad Solutions development server.

From `https://acdn.adnxs.com/as/*` 

--> to `https://adtechnology.axelspringer.com/dev/$1`

## How to redirect the requests?

We recommend to use the Chrome browser Plugin [Redirector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd)

### Settings for Redirector:
